#1: He creates a finite population with N=500. That means that the realizations of the response variable 
    as well as those of the auxiliary variable are taken from a finite population instead from an infinite population.
    This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the infinite population theory, which was exclusively used to derive all estimators 
    contained in "forestinventory". So in he reviewer's simulation code, he randomly samples s2 from a finite rather than an infinite 
    population. As a consequence of doing so, he also determines the true value by taking the mean of a finite population, rather
    than calculating the spatial mean (i.e. the integral) of the function determining the surface of the local density (as explained 
    in section 2.1).

    In order to avoid any confusion between the infinite and the finite population framework, we explained the fundamental basics of 
    the infinite population framework in very detail in section 2.1. The misunderstanding of the reviewer, who has without 
    question high expertise in the field of forest inventory and sampling theory, supported our decision to place a sound portion of 
    easily-explained theory in our article (maybe with the consequence making the article longer at some places).

#2: From the reviewer's simulation code, it is also obvious that he uses (in his finite framework) the entire population (N=500)
    of auxiliary values instead of taking a random sample of n1. By doing so
