\subsection{Two-Phase Sampling}


The two-phase or double-sampling estimators use inventory information from \textbf{two} nested samples which are commonly referred to as \textit{phases} (Figure \ref{fig:concmphase_and_sae_a}). The first phase $s_1$ comprises $n_1$ sample locations that each provide a set of explanatory variables described by the column vector $\pmb{Z}(x)\in{\Re^{p}}$ at each point $x \in s_1$. These explanatory variables are derived from auxiliary information that is available in high quantity within the forest area $F$. The second phase $s_2$ constitutes the terrestrial inventory conducted at $n_2$ subsamples of the large phase $s_1$ and provides the value of the target variable, i.e. the local density $Y(x)$ (e.g. the timber volume density per hectare). The set of explanatory variables at each sample location $x \in s_1$ is transformed into a prediction $\hat{Y}(x)$ of $Y(x)$ using a linear regression model with ordinary least square (OLS). The basic idea of this setup is to boost the sample size by providing a large sample of less precise but cheaper predictions of $Y(x)$ in $x \in s_1$ and to correct any possible model biases (i.e. $\EX{(Y(x)-\hat{Y}(x))}$) using the subsample of terrestrial inventory units where the "true value" of $Y(x)$ is observed. In the design-based context, the two-phase estimator is unbiased regardless of the model you use to produce the predictions.  This property comes from the assumption that each phase's sample is selected via simple random sampling. It should be noted that most forest inventories use systematic grids rather than simple random sampling, as is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:concmphase_and_sae_a}.  However, this is generally considered to be acceptable as long as the grid does not interact with periodic features in the forest structure (\cite{mandallaz2008} Chapter 7).
%In the \proglang{R} package \pkg{forestinventory}, estimators for two-phase sampling can be applied with the \code{twophase()} function.



\subsection{Three-Phase Sampling}


The three-phase or triple-sampling estimators extend the principle of two-phase sampling and use inventory information from \textbf{three} nested samples (\textit{phases}) (Figure \ref{fig:concmphase_and_sae_a}). The basic assumption is that auxiliary information is available in two different frequencies, i.e. sample sizes. The phase $s_0$ provides a large number $n_0$ of auxiliary information, whereas the phase $s_1$ provides additional auxiliary information that is only available at $n_1$ subsamples of $s_0$. The terrestrial information is then collected at a subsample $s_2$ of $s_1$ and $s_0$. The basic idea of three-phase sampling is that the additional set of auxiliary information $\pmb{Z}^{(1)}(x)\in{\Re^q}$ adds considerable explanatory power to the set of auxiliary information $\pmb{Z}^{(0)}(x)\in{\Re^p}$ available at all sample locations $x \in s_0$. From that it follows that we can define \textit{two nested} regression models. The \textit{full} set of predictor variables $\pmb{Z}^t(x)=(\pmb{Z}^{(0)t}(x),\pmb{Z}^{(1)t}(x))\in{\Re^{p+q}}$ in the sample $s_1$ can be used to calculate predictions $\hat{Y}_{1}(x)$ of $Y(x)$ at all sample locations $x \in s_1$. The regression model applicable to the $s_1$ phase is thus referred to as the \textit{full model}. Whereas we can only use the subset of auxiliary information $\pmb{Z}^{(0)}(x)$ in the so called \textit{reduced model} at the sample locations $x \in s_0$, it allows for creating a much larger sample of less accurate predictions $\hat{Y}_{0}(x)$. If there is a significant gain in model precision between the reduced and the full model and the sampling fraction between $s_0$ and $s_1$ is sufficiently large, the three-phase estimator normally leads to a further increase in estimation precision compared to the two-phase estimator. 
%In the \proglang{R} package \pkg{forestinventory}, estimators for three-phase sampling can be applied with the \code{threephase()} function.



\subsection{Small Area Estimation}


Small area estimation does not necessarily refer to small spatial areas but rather areas that contain little or no terrestrial sample.  In the design-based approach, if there are no terrestrial plots in the small area then there is nothing you can do and you will be forced to depend on the model you choose and accept its potential bias.  To formulate this mathematically, we want to make an estimation for a subregion $G$ of the entire inventory area $F$ (Figure \ref{fig:concmphase_and_sae_b}). If the spatial extent of the subregion is small with respect to the terrestrial sample density, the number of terrestrial sample locations within the subregion $n_{2,G}$ will be too small to provide sufficient estimation precision (i.e. the confidence intervals will be very large). In this case, the application of multiphase estimation procedures can be efficient. However, the terrestrial sample size is too small to justify fitting a separate regression model just that area. The idea is then to \textit{borrow strength} from the entire terrestrial sample $s_2$ of $F$ and then to apply this  model to the small area. The potential bias of applying that model in $G$ is then corrected for by using the model residuals derived from the small area $G$. If no terrestrial samples fall into a small area $G$ (i.e. $n_{2,G}=0$), this bias correction cannot be applied and the resulting \textit{synthetic} estimates are potentially biased. 
% Both two and three-phase small area estimators for synthetic and non-synthetic estimation can be applied by the \code{twophase()} and \code{threephase()} functions in the \proglang{R} package \pkg{forestinventory}.

\subsection{Design-based vs. model-dependent approach}


The selection of a suitable predictive model is an essential part in the application of multiphase inventories.  If the model is chosen poorly it could lead to inefficient use of the auxiliary information or even biased estimates.  This brings us to the two schools of thought concerning estimation: \textit{model-dependent} (also known as \textit{model-based}) and design-based. In the \textit{model-dependent} framework, the sample locations \textit{x} are fixed and the observation $Y(x)$ taken at location $x$ is assumed to be a random variable as the realization of a stochastic process. The model does not need to be fit from a probability sample, but it does need to be trusted in the sense that all of its model assumptions need to be verified.  For example, if we select a linear model using OLS then there is an implicit mathematical assumption that the residuals are \textit{iid}.  This model assumption needs to be empirically verified in order to avoid misinterpreting the regression coefficients and even the predictions. The unbiasedness of model-dependent estimators depend on the correct specification of the model, which means that extensive analyses and adjustments must be conducted to ensure that the model adequately describes the underlying stochastic process. In contrast, the \textit{design-based} (also called \textit{model-assisted}) approach rests upon the randomization of the sample locations $x$. At any given location $x_0$, the ground truth, $Y(x_0)$, is assumed to be fixed and \textit{not} the result of a stochastic process.  $Y(x)$ is random only because of the random selection of the plot locations $x$, which is determined by the sampling design.  A consequence of this approach is that the models used in the design-based regression estimators do no longer have to satisfy any model assumptions in the classical statistical sense (e.g. identical distribution and independence of the observation $Y(x)$, or stationarity assumption in the geostatistical frame), as it is the case in the model-based framework \cite{mandallaz2008}. The philosophy of the design-based approach is thus to use prediction models to \textit{improve} the efficiency of the estimators without having to \textit{rely} on their correct specification, which makes them very attractive to be used in official statistics. They are therefore also referred to as \textit{model-assisted}. The randomly distribution of the sample locations, which the design-based inference rests upon, is in practice often replaced by the use of systematic grids due to minimization of travelling cost in the terrestrial survey. However, there is reasonable and empirical evidence that softening this assumption is acceptable for point estimation as well as the variance estimation, which will in most cases by slightly overestimated \citep{mandallaz2008, mandallaz2016}.

\subsection{Package Structure}
\label{sec:packstruc}


In the \proglang{R} package \pkg{forestinventory}, estimators for two-phase and three-phase sampling can be applied with the \code{twophase()} and \code{threephase()} function. From these two overall function calls, various estimators for specific inventory scenarios under the chosen sampling design can be applied (Figure \ref{fig:struct_package}). The decision what estimator to use thereby follows a tree-like structure which can serve the user as a guideline. The first decision to make is whether an estimate and its variance should be computed for the entire inventory area (\textbf{global estimators}) or only for subregions of the entire inventory area (\textbf{small area estimators}). The next decision for both global and small area estimations is whether the explanatory variables were derived \textit{exhaustively} or \textit{non-exhaustively} over the inventory area. The first case allows for computing the exact mean $\bar{\pmb{Z}}$ of each explanatory variable over $s_1$ ($s_{1,G}$) and $s_0$ ($s_{0,G}$). In the second case, the mean of each explanatory variable over $s_1$ ($s_{1,G}$) and $s_0$ ($s_{0,G}$) can only be estimated by $\hat{\bar{\pmb{Z}}}$ which adds another component of uncertainty to the respective estimators. The package offers three small area estimators for both the exhaustive and non-exhaustive setup. The \textit{extended synthetic estimator} and the \textit{small area estimator} both apply a bias correction using the model residuals within small area $G$ and can only be applied if the terrestrial sample size $n_{2,G}$ within $G$ is $\geq 2$. The resulting point estimates and variances are asymptotically design-unbiased. If $n_{2,G}=0$, the bias correction can no longer be applied and the estimates of the repsective \textit{synthetic small area estimator} are potentially biased. The package also allows for calculating estimates solely based on the terrestrial sample $s_2$ (\textit{one-phase estimation}) by the \code{onephase()} function. All estimators are also available for \textit{cluster} sampling, in which case a sample unit consists of multiple, spatially agglomerated samples.

The following sections describe the mathematical details and the application of the multi-phase estimators implemented in the \proglang{R} package \pkg{forestinventory}. While \cite{mandallaz2008, mandallaz2013techa, mandallaz2013techb,mandallaz2015tech} provides an extensive derivation of all estimators, we will provide the mathematical formulas that are actually implemented in the package. We will also restrict to simple sampling and provide the equations for cluster sampling in the Appendix. A special case under cluster sampling is described in section \ref{sec:speccas_and_scen}.
