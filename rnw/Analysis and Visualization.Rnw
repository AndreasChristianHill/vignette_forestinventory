The package \pkg{forestinventory} also provides methods for \textit{analysing} and \textit{visualizing} the estimation results created by the \code{onephase}, \code{twophase} and \code{threephase} functions. 

\subsection{Analysis}

If we want to compare the results and performance of different estimation methods and estimators for a given global or small area inventory data set, the function to start with is \code{estTable()}. This function restructures the results of \code{onephase}, \code{twophase} and \code{threephase} estimations and merges them into one single data set that provides the basis for further analysis. For demonstration purposes, we will first recalculate the one-phase estimations as well as the two-phase and three-phase \textit{extended pseudo synthetic} and the \textit{pseudo synthetic} estimations for the \code{grisons} dataset:

\begin{small}
<<>>=
op <- onephase(formula = tvol~1, data = grisons,
               phase_id = list(phase.col = "phase_id_2p", terrgrid.id = 2),
               area = list(sa.col = "smallarea", areas = c("A", "B", "C", "D")))
@
\end{small}

\begin{small}
<<>>=
extpsynth_2p<- twophase(formula = tvol ~ mean + stddev + max + q75, data = grisons,
                        phase_id = list(phase.col = "phase_id_2p", terrgrid.id = 2),
                        small_area = list(sa.col = "smallarea", 
                                          areas = c("A", "B","C", "D"),
                                          unbiased = TRUE))
@
\end{small}

\begin{small}
<<>>=
psynth_2p <- twophase(formula = tvol ~ mean + stddev + max + q75, data = grisons,
                      phase_id = list(phase.col = "phase_id_2p", terrgrid.id = 2),
                      boundary_weights = "boundary_weights",
                      small_area = list(sa.col = "smallarea", 
                                        areas = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                                        unbiased = FALSE))
@
\end{small}
          
\begin{small}
<<>>=
extpsynth_3p<- threephase(formula.s0 = tvol ~ mean,
                formula.s1 = tvol ~ mean + stddev + max + q75, data = grisons,
                phase_id = list(phase.col = "phase_id_3p", s1.id = 1, terrgrid.id = 2),
                small_area=list(sa.col = "smallarea", areas = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                                unbiased = TRUE))
@
\end{small}

\begin{small}
<<>>=
psynth_3p<- threephase(formula.s0 = tvol ~ mean,
                formula.s1 = tvol ~ mean + stddev + max + q75, data = grisons,
                phase_id = list(phase.col = "phase_id_3p", s1.id = 1, terrgrid.id = 2),
                small_area = list(sa.col = "smallarea", 
                                  areas = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                                  unbiased = FALSE))
@
\end{small}

We can then aggregate all estimation objects in a \code{list} and pass it to the \code{estTable}-function:

\begin{small}
<<>>=
grisons.sae.table<- estTable(est.list = list(op, extpsynth_2p, psynth_2p,
                                             extpsynth_3p, psynth_3p),
                             sae = TRUE, 
                             vartypes = c("variance", "g_variance",  "ext_variance"))
@
\end{small}

The function merges the estimation results and returns a \code{list} object with the subclasses \code{"esttable"  "smallarea"}. If one prefers the \code{data.frame} format for further analysis, this can easily be done using \code{as.data.frame(grisons.sae.table)}. Note however that the package \pkg{forestinventory} provides several \code{S3} generic functions that particularly respond to the class \code{"esttable"}. Note that the \code{vartypes} argument can be used to restrict the \code{estTable} output to certain types of variances.

The structure of an \code{esttable} object is very similar to the objects created by the small area estimation functions of the package. However, the point estimates and variances from all estimation objects passed to \code{estTable} have been stored in one single column (\code{estimate} and \code{variance}) and can be distinguished by the variables \code{method}, \code{estimator} and \code{vartype} which specify the estimation method (one, two or threephase), the estimator and the type of variance that was applied. 

\begin{small}
<<eval=FALSE>>=
str(grisons.sae.table)
@
\end{small}

\begin{footnotesize}
<<echo=FALSE>>=
str(grisons.sae.table)
@
\end{footnotesize}

Note that \code{estTable} also returns the \textbf{\textit{estimation error}} (\code{error}) that is defined as the \textit{standard error} devided by the \textit{point estimate}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:esterror}
  error_{[\%]}=\frac{\sqrt{\hat{\var}(\hat{Y})}}{\hat{Y}}\cdot100
\end{equation}


As mentioned in the introduction (section \ref{sec:intro}), the application of multi-phase estimation techniques in forest practice have two main \textbf{goals}:  
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{\textbf{maintaining}} the one-phase estimation precision under reduced costs, i.e. reduced $s_2$ sample size
  \item \textit{\textbf{increasing}} the estimation precision at identical costs, i.e. without increasing the $s_2$ sample size
\end{enumerate}

The function \code{mphase.gain()} was particularly written to quantify the potential benefit of a multi-phase global or small area estimation compared to its respective one-phase estimation. The function takes an \code{esttable} object as input and returns a validation of which multi-phase method and estimator performed best in comparison to the onephase estimation (\textit{baseline}) in terms of estimation precision. If the \code{esttable} object contains more than one multi-phase estimation object, \code{mphase.gain} identifies the one with the smallest variance and compares it to the \code{onephase} estimation. The argument \code{pref.vartype} can be used to define what type of variance (\textit{g-weight} or \textit{external}) should be used for the comparison. Per default (\code{exclude.synth = TRUE}), synthetic estimations (\textit{synth} and \textit{psynth} estimator) are not considered for the comparison since they normally have a much smaller variance but to the cost of a potential bias.
