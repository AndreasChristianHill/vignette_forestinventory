Your submission

=C2=A0 JSS 3280

has just finished the post-processing stage. In order to continue in the
process there are a few changes that need to be made. Attached to this emai=
l
is a comments file where you can find all the necessary changes.

Please upload the full sources for your submission as a single .zip (or
.tar.gz) to http://www.jstatsoft.org/author/submissionReview/XXXX. It shoul=
d
contain:

(1) The full sources of the latest version of the software. (Binary version=
s
can be provided in addition.)=C2=A0

(2) The .tex, .bib, and final .pdf for the manuscript. Please name all file=
s
jssXXXX.tex, jssXXXX.bib, jssXXXX.pdf, and so on, where XXXX is the number
that has been assigned to your manuscript in the review process. =C2=A0Also
include all graphics in a Figures/ directory, uploaded as a compressed .zip
or .tar.gz file.

(3) Information on how to replicate the examples in the manuscript.
(Typically, this is a self-contained standalone script file that
loads/calls/sources the software package from (1). If data or other externa=
l
files are needed, that are not yet provided with the software package,
include these as well.) =C2=A0Please use subdirectories for Figures/ and Co=
de/,
and upload these subdirectories as a single .zip or .tar.gz file. =C2=A0All
scripts should be in the subdirectory Code/, and all figures produced by th=
e
scripts, if they are written to file, should be written to Figures/.
=C2=A0Please make sure only necessary files are included. =C2=A0That is, pl=
ease do
not include .aux, .log, etc. files and any unused files such as jss.cls,
jss.bst, jsslogo.jpg, etc.

Note for R authors: If you have prepared your manuscript using Sweave, the
files for replication of the examples in (3) can be produced by Sweave.
=C2=A0The files for the Code/ directory can be produced by Tangle (possibly
enhancing the comments). Also indicate in your submission that Sweave was
used.

After we receive the post-processed code for your
manuscript/software/replication materials, your submission will be=20
added to our publication queue. Due to various major changes in JSS over th=
e
last years, the publication delay (between being added to the queue and
final publication) is currently about one year. We apologize for any
inconveniences caused by this delay and ask for your patience. We try our
best to reduce the delay.

Thanks for choosing JSS and contributing to free statistical software.

Best regards,
